# Isoropia-II Automation

This project automates the execution of the **Isoropia II** software to process data in Excel/CSV format. The program reads the data, processes it using Isoropia II, and returns the results as a CSV file.

## Steps to Use the Software

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chandankr014/Isoropia-II.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the Directory

Change your working directory to the repository's folder:

```bash
cd Isoropia-II
```

### 3. Place Data and Isoropia II Executable

Ensure your input data file (Excel or CSV) and `IsoropiaII.exe` executable are in the same directory. You will need to provide the paths to both when running the script.

### 4. Provide the File Paths

You will need to specify:
- **Dataframe Path**: The path to your `.xlsx` or `.csv` file.
- **IsoropiaII.exe Path**: The path to the Isoropia II executable (`IsoropiaII.exe`).

### 5. Running the Program

To run the program, open a terminal with **administrator privileges** to avoid any read/write permissions issues, and execute the script with the required parameters:

### 6. Output

- The program processes the input file and returns a `dataframe.csv` containing the calculated results.
- It also prints the calculations during each iteration to give you real-time feedback on the process.

## Note

- Make sure to **run the terminal as an administrator** to avoid any potential read/write issues during execution.

## Features

- Automatically processes large datasets with **Isoropia II**.
- Outputs the results in a CSV format.
- Provides real-time feedback through printed calculations.
